                        <p>
                            I built FitPub primarily for myself to track my fitness activities and share them on the Fediverse.
                            I'm making it available for others to use, but please understand what you're getting into.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="h4 mb-3 mt-4">No Guarantees</h2>
                        <p>
                            <strong>This is a hobby project.</strong> I make no guarantees that:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All features will work as expected (or at all)</li>
                            <li>Your data won't be lost due to bugs, hardware failures, or cosmic rays</li>
                            <li>This instance will still be running in a year, a month, or even next week</li>
                            <li>The service will be available 24/7 without interruptions</li>
                            <li>New features will be added, or that existing bugs will be fixed</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="h4 mb-3 mt-4">Use at Your Own Risk</h2>
                        <p>
                            By using FitPub, you acknowledge and accept that:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You use this service entirely at your own risk</li>
                            <li>I am not liable for any data loss, privacy breaches, or other issues that may occur</li>
                            <li>You should keep backups of your important fitness data elsewhere</li>
                            <li>The service may be shut down at any time without notice (though I'll try to give a heads up)</li>
                            <li>I may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the service at any time</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="h4 mb-3 mt-4">Privacy & Data</h2>
                        <p>
                            I respect your privacy, but remember:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Activities marked as "Public" are federated across the Fediverse and may be seen by anyone</li>
                            <li>GPS tracks include exact location data - be careful what you share publicly</li>
                            <li>I don't sell your data because, honestly, who would want to buy it?</li>
                            <li>The server logs may contain your IP address and activity data for debugging purposes</li>
                            <li>If you want your data deleted, just ask - I'll do my best to help</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="h4 mb-3 mt-4">User Conduct</h2>
                        <p>
                            Please be a decent human being:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don't abuse the service or try to break it on purpose</li>
                            <li>Don't upload illegal content or content that violates others' rights</li>
                            <li>Don't spam, harass, or otherwise annoy other users</li>
                            <li>Don't try to access other users' private data</li>
                            <li>If you find a security issue, please let me know instead of exploiting it</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="h4 mb-3 mt-4">Federation & ActivityPub</h2>
                        <p>
                            FitPub federates with other ActivityPub-compatible services:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you post a public activity, it gets sent to your followers' servers</li>
                            <li>I have no control over what other servers do with your data once it's federated</li>
                            <li>I may block or limit federation with specific servers for any reason</li>
                            <li>Once data is federated, deleting it here doesn't guarantee deletion elsewhere</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="h4 mb-3 mt-4">Open Source</h2>
                        <p>
                            FitPub is open source software. You can:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Review the code to see what it does</li>
                            <li>Run your own instance if you want more control</li>
                            <li>Contribute improvements if you're feeling generous</li>
                            <li>Fork it and make something better</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="h4 mb-3 mt-4">Changes to These Terms</h2>
                        <p>
                            I may update these terms occasionally. I'll try to notify users of significant changes,
                            but let's be honest - you probably won't read them anyway.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="h4 mb-3 mt-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
                        <p>
                            FitPub is a passion project that I'm sharing with the community. It's free to use,
                            but comes with no warranties or guarantees. If you need enterprise-grade reliability
                            and support, this probably isn't the right service for you. But if you're okay with
                            a scrappy, independent fitness tracking platform that federates with the open web,
                            then welcome aboard!
                        </p>

                            I'll help if I can, but I can't promise anything.
